# Hi there, I'm Vivek! 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivek70914
- 👀 I’m interested in **DevOps**, **Cloud Computing**, **Automation**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC). I’m passionate about optimizing software delivery processes and building scalable infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Jenkins**. I'm diving deeper into **monitoring**, **logging**, and **cloud security** to streamline DevOps workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **DevOps automation projects**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **containerization**, and **cloud infrastructure**. If you're working on any related projects or have something exciting in mind, feel free to reach out!
